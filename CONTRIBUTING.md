The Code Style/Format is maintained using the Black Code Formatter. Please make sure to run the code through the formatter before making a pull request.

```bash
python -m black .
```

The code should also be well documented and should follow the PEP8 guidelines.

## File Guide <a name = "file-guide"></a>

The code is written in Cython's Pure Python Mode.

so, `*.py` are the normal python code. and `*.pxd` are the Cython Declarations. (In a sense these are the header files)

The `*.c` are C files generated by Cython. [Not Needed, so remove them before making a PR]

And That's it! ðŸŽ‰
